**There is always room for improvements!**  
If you want to be part of the MicroWind project 
feel free to share your valuable knowledge and skills.  
Following a list of things that could be beneficial 
to the project and the building experience:
* Taking pictures of the build process for the documentation. (easy)
* Redesign of tower for easier assembly. (some 3D design experience needed)
* Tolerance tolerant design of all parts that are mounted inside the wind tunnel tubes. (some 3D design experience needed)
* Replace the load resistor switch circuit with 
continuous current control for smooth torque control (electronic skills needed)
* Improve the current measurement, which is very noisy (maybe higher shunt resistor)(electronic skills needed)
* Check if the BS 170 Mosfets can be replaced with IRLD 024, to reduce variety of parts
* Improve the thermal anemometer reading, which is very noisy (electronic skills needed)
* ...
